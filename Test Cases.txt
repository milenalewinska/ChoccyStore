. Monitor server resource utilization (CPU, memory, bandwidth) during login attempts.
. Evaluate the login page's response time during peak usage hours.
. Evaluate the system's ability to handle high volumes of simultaneous login attempts.
. Conduct load testing to determine the maximum concurrent user logins the system can handle.
. Evaluate the impact of CAPTCHA validation on login page performance.
. Test the security of password reset and account recovery processes.
. Test for insecure password policies (e.g., weak password requirements).
